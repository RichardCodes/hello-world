# hello-world
An amazing repository

So last time i edited this file and the i was supposed to create a pull request. But it didn't say to save this file so I when I compared to the master branch it said they are identical. Wait, let me check if the guide said to save the changes somehow.

I checked and who would have thought, I am stupid. I didn't read two steps that said to save it, so I'll follow these steps now.
